/* We use one of the general-purpose timers to track our 't' value. These
 * timers count up at the CPU clock rate. At each point, t = (count / cmax).
 *
 * The oscillator has four states: off, init, running, and reinit. In 'off',
 * it is not counting at all. The first tap causes it to enter 'init'. The
 * next tap causes it to enter 'running'. After that, a tap may cause it to
 * enter the 'reinit' stage, for changing bpm on the fly. 
 *
 * When the first tap occurs, the counter is startd. The handler for the
 * next tap examines the counter, resets it, and sets count_max to the
 * previous value.
 * 
 * After that, a tap is used to refine the oscillator's estimate of the bpm.
 * If a tap happens at a significantly unexpected time, the oscillator will
 * change to the 'reinit' state, so that it more quickly converges on a new
 * bpm setting.
 *
 * The oscillator's t value must smoothly ramp across the same range on
 * every cycle. This means that there are actually two beats that are tracked.
 * The tap input's frequency is tracked in 'freq' and its phase, relative to
 * the current counter value, is in 'tap_delta'. The counter itself forms a
 * second oscillator that tracks the beat in frequency and phase.
